Not sosinister poem

The sky is black
The flowers are black
My soul is black
My dog is black

my pony is black
My usb is black
Denzel Washington is black
The universe is obscure

but the rainbow is still full of colors

but may cell phone is still black
my notebook is black
my computer is black

The end
